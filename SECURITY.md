## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since the project is still in development, we do not have a formal security response process in place.  
If you discover a vulnerability, you can still [open an issue](../../issues) or submit a pull request.  
Please note that fixes will be addressed on a best-effort basis and there is **no guaranteed response time**.
