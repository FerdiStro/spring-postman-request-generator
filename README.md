# Plugin Description
<!-- Plugin description -->
**IMPORTANT: Currently under development - functionality still limited and partially buggy. Feel free to contribute and improve the plugin.**

Generate Postman collections directly from your Spring controllers without leaving IntelliJ IDEA.  
This plugin adds a convenient gutter icon next to methods annotated with `@RequestMapping`.  
With a single click, it creates a ready-to-use Postman collection (`generated-request.json`) in your project root.

**Features:**
- One‚Äëclick Postman collection generation from Spring `@RequestMapping` methods
- Seamless integration into the IntelliJ editor (gutter icon navigation)
- Exports valid Postman JSON collections ready for import
- Simplifies testing and documentation of your REST endpoints

Perfect for developers who want to quickly test their Spring APIs in Postman without manually creating requests.
